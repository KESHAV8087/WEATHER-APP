# WEATHER-APP

Weather apps enable users to get instant alerts regarding weather conditions. Weather apps are the simplest method to know about the updates of the upcoming weather.
I have created this weather app using python by importing the beautifulsoup library.
Beautiful Soup: This is a library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. This library creates “parse trees,” allowing for easy data extraction. 
It is a web scraping project .
